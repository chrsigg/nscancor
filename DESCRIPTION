Title: Non-Negative and Sparse CCA
Description: Two implementations of canonical correlation analysis
        (CCA) that are based on iterated regression. By choosing the
        appropriate regression algorithm for each data domain, it is
        possible to enforce sparsity, non-negativity or other kinds of
        constraints on the projection vectors. Multiple canonical
        variables are computed sequentially using a generalized
        deflation scheme, where the additional correlation not
        explained by previous variables is maximized. 'nscancor' is
        used to analyze paired data from two domains, and has the same
        interface as the 'cancor' function from the 'stats' package
        (plus some extra parameters). 'mcancor' is appropriate for
        analyzing data from three or more domains. See

        details.
